Smile
You can forget about your life
Smile
You can forget about your life
The truth will follow you
The truth will follow you
The proof will swallow you up
Holy shit, you got some action
Pictures or it didn't happen

Smile, smile
Your teeth are broke
And it's all right
Smile, smile
Your teeth are broke
And it's all right
They'll break the best of you
They'll break the best of you
It makes you beautiful
So fists into the lips of fashion
Pictures or it didn't happen

I had such an awful dream
Last night
Everybody's faces were too tight
Please don't leave me
In this nightless light
God, I'm gonna miss you when you
Smile
The end is near
And it's high time
Smile, smile, smile
The end is near
And it's high time
The light's amazing, man
So time your Instagram
The rapture
Swallowing the land
But we're the last ones laughing
Pictures or it didn't happen
(Get it 'cause we'll all be dead
And no one dead can use a camera)

I had such an awful dream last night
Everybody's faces
Went all white
Everybody in the world
Was either
Getting killed or getting footage of the killing
That they sent to surgeons working in the sky

I don't wanna
I don't wanna go to
I don't wanna go to Cali
I don't wanna go to California

I don't want to die
I don't want to die
I don't want to die
