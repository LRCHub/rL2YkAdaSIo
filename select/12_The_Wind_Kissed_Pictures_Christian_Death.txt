He cried
Had I been happy
Everything was so fresh
On the chest of the boy
And what of the lowerworld
Let us fly into the mantle of fire
Should we love the upperworld.
The wind kissed pictures
The son followed close behind
The father he was never again to behold
The shovels wept with the earth they flung

And what of the lowerworld
Let us fly into the mantle of fire
Should we love the upperworld

The wind kissed pictures

He dreamt so much of happines
It matters not to have been born

And what of the lowerworld
Let us fly into the mantle of fire
Should we love the upperworld

The wind kissed pictures

Let us stop pretending
Ashes to dust and so we must
Lie where the water is deepest

She sat the loving day upon her palace
He was lying on a moor among the reeds
And the wind kissed pictures
