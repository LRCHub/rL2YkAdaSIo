Well nobody wants to burn in hell
But everybody's got a soul to sell
When I was young my mama gave me some advice
She said boy don't you know everybody's got a price?
I make lots of money, I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If its not to be noted I got somethin' better for ya
Naked pictures, of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures, of your mother GO!
I dropped the bomb on Japan
I was a hostage in Iran
I'm the ugly American
Now, I'm a government man
A government man!
I make lots of money, I make more money than you
I drive around in my limo that's what I was born to do
And I might like you better if we fought together
If its not to be noted I got somethin' better for ya
Naked pictures, of your mother
Naked pictures of your mother
Naked pictures, of your mother GO!
